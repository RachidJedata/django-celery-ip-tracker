# Django Celery IP Tracker

This project is a **Django-based IP tracker** with background task processing using **Celery** and **Redis**.  
It demonstrates how to track requests, flag suspicious IP addresses, and schedule background jobs, all orchestrated with **Docker Compose**.

---

## Features

- **Django App** – Main web application with REST APIs and admin panel.
- **Celery Worker** – Processes background tasks (e.g., IP flagging).
- **Celery Beat** – Scheduler for periodic tasks (like a cron service).
- **Redis** – Acts as a broker and result backend for Celery, and as cache for Django.
- **MySQL** – Relational database to store users, requests, and logs.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed  
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/django-celery-ip-tracker.git
cd django-celery-ip-tracker
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
MYSQL_DATABASE=ip_tracker
MYSQL_USER=normal_user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=user
MYSQL_ROOT_USER=root
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=toor
```

3. Build and start all services using Docker Compose:
